🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning 🧠
In this project, we explore machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on a dataset of real estate features 🏘️. We utilize classification algorithms to derive insights and make predictions 📈.

Features:
🗃️ Dataset: A dataset containing multiple features like location, size, number of rooms, etc., that influence house prices.
📊 Data Analysis: Preprocessing the dataset for missing values, outliers, and feature scaling to prepare it for model training.
🧠 Machine Learning Models: Applying classification algorithms to predict whether a house price falls into specific categories.
🔍 Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure robust predictions.

Files:
House_Price1.csv 📁: The dataset file containing information about various houses and their features.
ML_on_HousePrice_Data.ipynb 📓: Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
ML_on_House_Price_Data_using_Classification.ipynb 📓: Jupyter Notebook implementing the machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
